# Program Logo Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for program logos. 

## Instructions:
1. Create a 40x40 pixel PNG image with a light gray background
2. Add a simple icon or text like "LOGO" in the center
3. Use a subtle border to make it visible
4. Save it as `placeholder.png` in this directory

## Alternative:
You can use any existing image from your assets folder as a placeholder, such as:
- `../assets/images/Icon.png`
- `../assets/images/Icon-1.png`
- Or create a simple SVG placeholder

## CSS Fallback:
The CSS already includes proper styling for the placeholder with:
- Light gray background
- Border
- Proper sizing (40x40px desktop, 32x32px mobile)
- Rounded corners
